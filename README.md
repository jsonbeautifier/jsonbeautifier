JSON beutifier is an online tool. it will help to edit JSON formatter online. JSON is used to represent structured data, such as objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null values. It provides a way to organize and store data in a format that can be easily understood by both humans and machines.

JSON is not tied to any specific programming language, making it a universal data format that can be used in various programming environments. JSON uses a simple and readable text format, which makes it easy for developers to create and edit JSON data by hand, and it's also easy for humans to interpret.

JSON is commonly used for data exchange between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server. When you make an API request to a web service, the response is often returned in JSON format. JSON is used in configuration files for software applications. Many configuration files, like those for web servers, databases, and other software, are written in JSON.

Unlike JavaScript, which can execute code, JSON is a data format and does not execute any code. This makes it safe for handling untrusted data, such as data obtained from user input.

JSON code is a text-based format for representing structured data. JSON code consists of key-value pairs, where keys are strings, and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. Here's an example of JSON code:

The JSON data is enclosed in curly braces {}.
It contains several key-value pairs, separated by colons :. For example, "name": "John Doe" and "age": 30.
Strings are enclosed in double quotes, like "name", "John Doe".
Numbers do not have quotes, like 30.
Booleans are represented as true or false.
Arrays are enclosed in square brackets [] and can contain multiple values, like "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"].
Objects are nested JSON structures enclosed in curly braces, like "address": { ... }.


{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}

we have an object with three key-value pairs: "name," "age," and "city." The keys are strings, and the values can be strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, or nested objects. JSON is a popular data format for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and is supported by many programming languages.
